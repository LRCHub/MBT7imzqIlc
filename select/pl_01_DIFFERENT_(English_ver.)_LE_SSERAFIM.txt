If you ready, I'm that girl
Type that make you feel
you're in another world
Keep it chill yeah cherry swirl
Type of flavor keep you
on your toes I'm sure
I go bad but I'm good enough
I'm too bad,
are you good enough?
It's so sad you
Ain't felt the love
like this before
Tell me why you
stand over there
When you could be
right over here
Got all my girls on this end
Get a taste of something
different
I got the sauce
so if you wanna try
Something different
different different
Then you know
I'm the one you should call
I'm going long
I know you heard about it
And it's different
different different
Like nothing you ever had at all
Get a taste of something
different
Gotta hold on tight
Gotta stay on
for the ride of your life
Know what you want
even when you're tongue-tied
Hands in my back pocket
by the end of the night
You could feel the vibe I'm on
Baby don't you take too long
I can feel the moment come
Don't wait til it's gone
I go bad but I'm good enough
I'm too bad,
are you good enough?
It's so sad you
Ain't felt the love
like this before
Tell me why you stand over there
When you could be
right over here
Got all my girls on this end
Get a taste of something
different
I got the sauce
so if you wanna try
Something different
different different
Then you know
I'm the one you should call
I'm going long
I know you heard about it
And it's different
different different
Like nothing you ever had at all
Get a taste of something
different
